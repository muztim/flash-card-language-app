Flash Card App

Great app to learn stuff.
One side of the card has a French word and the other side has the meaning as an English word.
After 3s the card flips to reveal the other side.
If you click ✔ (meaning you know the word) the program removes the word from the list of words to be learnt.
If you click ❌ (meaning you don't know) the program shows another French word.

This program can be used to learn language a certain topic e.g coding. Have fun with it
